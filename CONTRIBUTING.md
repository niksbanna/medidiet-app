### Running Tests and Checks

```bash
# Run linter
pnpm lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run on specific platforms
pnpm ios      # iOS simulator
pnpm android  # Android emulator
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with one of these prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/meal-photo-recognition`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/calorie-calculation-diabetes`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/health-context`)
- `test/` - Adding tests (e.g., `test/ai-service`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make focused commits**
   - Keep changes small and focused
   - One logical change per commit
   - Test frequently as you develop

3. **Write tests** (when applicable)
   - Add tests for new features
   - Ensure existing tests still pass

4. **Update documentation**
   - Update README if needed
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
   - Update type definitions

5. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test on both iOS and Android
   - Test with and without internet (for AI fallback)
   - Test with different medical conditions
   - Verify loading and error states

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(meal-plan): add weekly meal plan generation with AI
fix(diabetes): correct carb calculation for type 2 diabetes
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve meal card spacing and colors
refactor(ai-service): simplify error handling logic
test(health-context): add tests for BMI calculation
chore(deps): update expo to version 53.0.9
```

### TypeScript Style Guide

**General Rules:**
- ✅ Always use TypeScript, never plain JavaScript
- ✅ Enable strict mode (already configured)
- ✅ Provide explicit types for function parameters and return values
- ✅ Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
- ❌ Never use `any` type - use proper types or `unknown`

**Examples:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Explicit types
interface MealPlan {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  meals: Meal[];
}

function calculateCalories(meals: Meal[]): number {
  return meals.reduce((total, meal) => total + meal.calories, 0);
}

// ❌ Bad - Missing types
function calculateCalories(meals) {
  return meals.reduce((total, meal) => total + meal.calories, 0);
}

// ❌ Bad - Using any
function processMeal(meal: any): void {
  // ...
}
```

### React Native Best Practices

**Component Structure:**

```typescript
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// 1. Interfaces/Types
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onPress?: () => void;
}

// 2. Constants
const DEFAULT_PADDING = 16;

// 3. Main Component
export default function MyComponent({ title, onPress }: MyComponentProps) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// 4. Styles
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: DEFAULT_PADDING,
    backgroundColor: '#F5F7FA',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

**Key Practices:**
- ✅ Use functional components with hooks
- ✅ Use `StyleSheet.create()` for styles
- ✅ Wrap screens with `SafeAreaView`
- ✅ Handle loading and error states
- ✅ Use existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- ❌ Avoid inline styles (except for dynamic values)
- ❌ Avoid class components
- ❌ Don't skip error handling

**Design System:**
```typescript
// Use constants from constants/Colors.ts
import Colors from '@/constants/Colors';

// Headers: 28px, Bold
// Titles: 20px, Bold
// Body: 15px, Medium
// Small: 13px, Regular

// Colors:
// Primary: #0066CC
// Success: #4CAF50
// Warning: #FF9800
// Error: #FF6B6B
// Background: #F5F7FA
```

### Medical Safety Guidelines

When working with health-related features:

1. **Always validate health inputs**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   function validateWeight(weight: number): boolean {
     return weight > 0 && weight < 500; // Reasonable range
   }
   ```

2. **Include disclaimers**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   <MedicalDisclaimer text="This is for educational purposes only. Consult your healthcare provider." />
   ```

3. **Handle medical conditions carefully**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good - Condition-specific validation
   if (userProfile.medicalConditions.includes('diabetes')) {
     // Apply diabetes-specific dietary restrictions
   }
   ```

4. **Respect data privacy**
   - All health data stored locally
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Use secure storage for authentication tokens
